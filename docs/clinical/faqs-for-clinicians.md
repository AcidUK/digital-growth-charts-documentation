# Frequently Asked Questions for Clinicians

## What are the main differences between the old paper or PDF Growth Charts and the dGC Project?

* Paper or PDF charts required a human to plot the measurement and then read off the Centile. Digital Growth Charts automatically calculate Centiles and SDS (Standard Deviation Score) from the measurements, and plot these on a digital chart for you.

* Digital Growth Charts include recommended SNOMED-CT clinical terminology to guide persistence of the returned values

## Q: How do I get the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts in my EPR?

A: As a first step, we would suggest to discuss with the CIO (Chief Information Officer) and CCIO (Chief Clinical Information Officer) at your trust, or their equivalents in your place of work.

Hopefully this can lead on to further discussion with the IT team at your place of work, which should hopefully establish lines of communication with the supplier of the Electronic Patient Record (EPR).

Many EPR suppliers will have already started the process of integrating the RCPCH dGC API into their product, and we are happy to assist vendors with integration once they purchase a subscription.

## How much do the RCPCH dGC APIs cost?

The APIs themselves are run on a sustainable non-profit basis by the RCPCH, which is a charitable organisation. The aim is for modest revenues from the API to be fed back into development of future APIs and new features.

Pricing tiers for the API are shortly to be published, and usually the EPR vendor or integration service would pay for this directly, however the costs are likely to be passed on to you, the customer.

Pricing depends on the volume of requests that the vendor requires and the amount of support they need.

The process of integrating the API into an existing EPR product is technically straightforward and the amount of work is modest. EPR suppliers may of course levy a fee for this additional integration work, however once this has been done once for a product, there should be minimal or zero additional work to roll out to other sites, so you should check whether the vendor has already deployed the dGC elsewhere.

## Can I test the dGC APIs?

Yes, you can use the demo site at https://growth.rcpch.ac.uk/ to evaluate the service.
