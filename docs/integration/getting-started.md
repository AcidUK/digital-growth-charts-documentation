## Swagger / openAPI3 specification

- Our API code auto-generates a Swagger / openAPI3 specification each time we make changes to the server

<img src="https://validator.swagger.io/validator?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rcpch/digital-growth-charts-server/alpha/openapi.yml">

- The openAPI spec is available as YAML or JSON in the root of the Server repository

- You can also get the spec from the `/` (root) of https://api.rcpch.ac.uk where it is served in JSON format (API key required)

## Postman tooling

We have used Postman extensively in the development of the dGC API. We have created Postman collections to help with understanding the API in use. You can use these 'example' API transactions to learn about how the API responds to requests.
