# React Chart Component (stable)

Although the process of obtaining a centile/SDS result from the API is very straightforward, rendering this to an actual digital growth chart graphic is quite complex, mainly because of the requirement to render the 9 curved 'centile lines' as well as plot the co-ordinates of the API result.

For this reason, we have produced, as part of the dGC MVP, a permissively-licensed open-source React component, which aims to simplify the process of creating a chart from the chart data received from the API. It makes the job of drawing a vector-graphic centile chart much easier.

You can use the component as-is in a React app, or include it in plain HTML or any other JavaScript framework.


## Using the Chart Component in your application

## Why React?

We chose React because of its current popularity and relative stability. Also a consideration was the fact that React can be used in a subsection of a page, in contrast with some other Javascript fameworks such as Angular or Ember, which are designed for Single Page Applications and as such, expect to control the entire page.

!!! question "Tell us what you think"
    Let us know what you think of our design decisions, on this or any other area of the dGC Project, by chatting to us on our [dGC Forum](https://openhealthhub.org/c/rcpch-digital-growth-charts/) :fontawesome-brands-discourse:

## What about other frameworks/UI libraries?

If you need us to develop a charting component in a different language or framework, we may be able to do this with you or your company, however we would need to discuss the requirements and quote for this service. You should be aware that all such RCPCH-developed artefacts will also be open source. We will of course ensure that the licensing of such open source components is compatible with commercial use.
