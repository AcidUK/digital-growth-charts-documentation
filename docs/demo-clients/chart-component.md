# React Chart Component

Although the process of obtaining a centile/SDS result from the API is very straightforward, rendering this to an actual digital growth chart graphic is quite complex, mainly because of the requirement to render the 9 curved 'centile lines' as well as plot the co-ordinates of the API result.

For this reason, we have produced, as part of the dGC MVP, a permissively-licensed open-source React component, which aims to simplify the process of creating a chart from the chart data received from the API. It makes the job of drawing a vector-graphic centile chart much easier.

You can use the component as-is in a React app, or even include it in part of an SPA which uses another type of front-end framework.


## Using the Chart Component in your application

## Why React?

## What about other frameworks/UI libraries?

If you need us to develop a charting component in a different language or framework, we may be able to do this with you/your company, however there will be some cost to this service and you should be aware that all such RCPCH-developed artefacts will also be open source. We will of course ensure that the licensing of such open source components is compatible with commercial use.
