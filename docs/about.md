## About the UK RCPCH Growth Chart API Project

The project team was commissioned by NHS England to produce a 'Minimum Viable Product' API (Application Programming Interface) to generate reliable results for growth data from children 1 year and below. The project team began work in May 2020.





In development, the project found it was feasible to extend the scope of the MVP to include children of all ages.

Further we have been able to develop several demonstration clients showing ease of integration with the API.
