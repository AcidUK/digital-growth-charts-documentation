!!! tip
    This section of the documention is **not** for users or integrators of the dGC API - if you simply want to use the API and other 'consumable' components then go [here](docs/integration/getting-started.md)
    
If you would like to get involved in developing and improving the codebase of the RCPCH Digital Growth Charts API project, these pages detail some of the setup and working practices we are using.
