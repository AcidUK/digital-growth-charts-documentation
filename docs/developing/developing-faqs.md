## Q: The dGC API Server is open source, so should I be self-hosting it?

A: No. In general, people should not be self hosting the API server. Only the version deployed and managed by the RCPCH team is warranted to be correct. If you are running the code on your own server then you must be prepared to have the appropriate clinical and technical assurance performed. You would require MHRA registration for your medical device. By using the RCPCH-provided API you avoid all that requirement and use our commodity server.

## Q: Where is all your dGC code?

A: All the code for all our Digital Growth Chart work is publicly available on GitHub, in the `rcpch` organisation. See <https://github.com/rcpch>

## Q: Why did you build the API in Python?

A: See [this page](docs/developing/why-python.md)
