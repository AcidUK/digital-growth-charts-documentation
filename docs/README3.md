# Date and Age Calculations

## Decimal Age

Decimal age is expressed as a decimal fraction in units of years. It is calculated as the number of days / 365.25. The extra 0.25 is to account for the leap year which comes round every 4 years.

A pregnancy lasts 40 weeks (280 days). This is calculated from the date of the baby's mother's last menstrual period. In fact, from that date, ovulation occurs midway through the following cycle (on average 14 days into a 28 day cycle). This means that from conception, a pregnancy actually lasts only 266 days. Babies are considered to have been born 'term' if delivered anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks gestation (3 weeks before to 2 weeks after the due date).

The due date is referred to as the Estimated Date of Delivery (EDD).

## Gestational Age / Post-menstrual Age

Gestational age at birth is the gestation at which the infant was born, and represents the number of weeks (and extra days) since the last menstrual period. It is often shortened to gestational age, at birth being assumed.

After delivery, the gestational age of preterm infants is often tracked by clinicians in addition to chronological age (and is sometimes referred to as post-menstrual age).

## Chronological Decimal Age

This is the time elapsed since birth, in years, irrespective of the gestational age at birth. For example the chronological age at EDD, i.e. at 40 weeks gestation, of a baby born at 24 weeks gestation would be 16 weeks or (16 x 7)/365.25 = 0.31 years.

## Corrected Decimal Age

This is the age of a child born preterm calculated from their _due date_ rather than their _birth date_, which will be earlier than their due date. This adjusts for the immaturity of preterm babies being born early. The process is referred to as gestational age correction, and prior to digital growth charts it was a _manual_ process.

Prior to digital growth charts, the convention was to apply gestational age correction to all babies born before 37 weeks gestation. For those born at 32-36 weeks the correction was applied until the baby was 1 year old, and below 32 weeks until they were 2 years old (based on corrected rather than chronological age).

Now that the correction is applied automatically by the API, the Project Board decided that it made no sense to stop the correction at arbitrary ages, and it should be applied throughout childhood. (Of course, the difference between corrected and uncorrected age becomes less apparent as the child gets older.)

A further Project Board decision was to extend the gestational age correction to all children, including those born at term. This represents a departure from the previous practice of using a common reference for all term gestation babies, averaged across gestations 37-42 weeks. Now term babies, like preterm babies, are assessed using their gestational age.

# Scope

Currently the minimum viable product is to provide reliable calculations for all children in the UK under the age of 1 year for height, weight, body mass index (BMI) and head circumference ('occipitofrontal circumference' - OFC).

In addition to providing standard deviation scores (SDS) and centiles, it will also provide basic guidance for users on how to interpret the information received.

It is envisaged that once established and validated, older age groups will be included, and also other growth references.

It is planned that the API will in future be able to handle measurements over multiple occasions for individual children, with a view to interpreting their growth trajectory, as well as _'thrive lines'_[5][6](#references)

# Growth Charting Introduction

The UK-WHO 0-4 year old charts were officially launched on May 11th 2009. Any child born after that date should be plotted on a UK-WHO growth chart. Children born before May 11th 2009 are plotted on British 1990 (UK90) charts and subsequent measurements must be plotted using those charts. After age 4 the two charts are the same.

## The LMS Method

It is now common practice to express child growth status in the form of SD scores - the number of standard deviations away from the mean (also known as a z-score). The SD score can be converted to a centile.

The LMS method provides a way of obtaining normalized growth centiles from a relatively small original dataset, applying smoothing and extrapolation such that the resulting L, M and S curves contain the information to draw **any** centile curve, and to convert measurements (even extreme values) into exact SD scores. The growth reference is summarised by a table of LMS values at a series of ages.

### How the LMS method is used

- Look up in the LMS table for the relevant measurement (e.g. height) the age and sex-specific values of L, M and S for the child. If the child's age falls between the tabulated ages, use cubic interpolation to obtain values for the child's exact age.

- To obtain the z-score, plug the LMS values with the child's measurement into the formula:
  ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\=z={[(Measurement / M)-1] \over L S})

## Growth References

This is a growing list of growth references for children. These cover a number of specific medical conditions as well as a range of different physiological parameters. It will continue to be added to as the data become available. As a side-project of this work we are interested in collating an international library of growth references in computable format, which is at https://github.com/rcpch/growth-references and further details are available in that repository.

# Privacy

## Privacy Policy

Our RCPCH dGC API Privacy Policy can be viewed on our Developer Portal

https://dev.rcpch.ac.uk/privacy

## Stateless API

The server has been designed with privacy and information security in mind.

The API is 'stateless', meaning it does **not** persist information between the web requests that are made of it. Each request from the API-consuming application contains all the information required to calculate a set of centile data. The response we send back contains this data, and it is never saved on the server. Some information about requests is kept for a few days in the logs of our server, to enable us to monitor performance and to debug problems, however this information is anonymous.

Any 'persistence' (data saving) must happen in the application which is consuming the API, which is the natural place to persist data anyway, since this is the DPCHR, the GP system, the hospital EPR - which already likely persists lots of data about the patient.

In view of the stateless nature of the server, we don't handle any Patient Identifiable Data. We have reviewed the privacy implications of our application and believe it does not require a Data Privacy Impact Assessment, according to our review of [current Information Commissioner's Office guidance](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments/#dpia3).
