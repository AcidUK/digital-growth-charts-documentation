## Why Python?

- Python has become the de-facto language of the scientifica and bioinformatics communities.
- Most of the packages we needed were '1st party' ie maintained by the PSF
- We think it's a nice language to use.
- It's accessible to clinicians who want to learn to code, and it's easy enough to learn that it's taught in schools.
- It has everything we needed for building an API and web layers we needed.
